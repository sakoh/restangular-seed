restangular-seed
================

This is a port of the original angular seed, I reformatted it, moving a lot of logic from controllers to ProjectFactory for the sake of cleaner code organization.

The [live example](http://plnkr.co/edit/d6yDka?p=preview) for [Restangular](https://github.com/mgonto/restangular) converted to use the structure of an [angular-seed](https://github.com/angular/angular-seed) project.
